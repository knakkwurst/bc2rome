## Prerequisites

  - A Linux machine (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, etc.)
  - Docker Engine installed (refer to Docker's official installation guide for your Linux distribution)
  - Git installed

## Getting-started

### Verify-Docker-Installation

  Open a terminal window.
  To verify that Docker is installed and running, enter the following command:
  ```
  docker --version
  ```
  You should see the Docker version information displayed.
  
### Pull-BC2ROME-Docker-Image
  Create Folder
   ```
  mkdir server
  ```
  Change Directory
  ```
  cd ./server
  ```
  Clone Repo
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/knakkwurst/bc2rome.git
  ```
  Get Docker Image
  ```
  sudo docker pull russianvivi/bc2rome:latest
  ```

## Managing-Server
Once the Docker image is downloaded, you can start the container to run the server. 
```
cd ./bc2rome
```
```
sudo docker container run -p 19567:19567 -p 48888:48888/tcp -v "./Instance:/project/R34_Full/Instance" russianvivi/bc2rome:latest
```
It may be that some distributions need the absolute path
```
sudo docker container run -p 19567:19567 -p 48888:48888/tcp -v "<absolutePath>bc2rome/Instance:/project/R34_Full/Instance" russianvivi/bc2rome:latest
```

To determ the container id run:
```
sudo docker container ls
```
Use Container ID to kill
```
sudo docker container kill <CONTAINER ID>
```
## Accessing-Server (Client)
It's essential to ensure that you have the latest game update installed and [ProjectRome](https://veniceunleashed.net/downloads)
After downloading Project Rome, follow these steps:

   - Unzip the downloaded file to extract its contents
   - Locate the file named dinput8.dll from the extracted files
   - Place the dinput8.dll file into your game directory

## Game-Server-Configuration
You can configure a lot on R34, for comprehensive documentation, you can download DOCS [here](https://mega.nz/file/zjhkTbqZ#5kbq4FnHke9-C7IzU4m28fJ0MzbCfZ30cJiPxFXagWk) (not uploaded by me).
However, here's a quick overview of the basic configuration steps:

Open ServerOptions.ini 
```
nano ./Instance/ServerOptions.ini
```
- Change your Admin Password (RemoteAdminPassword=Password)

- Change Server Name (Name=ServerName) This refers to the name of your game server, which will be displayed in the server browser.

Open Startup.txt
```
nano ./Instance/ServerOptions.ini
```
- Change/Remove Banner (Remove all or replace Url (512x64 smaller than 127kb, .PNG format))

#Banner 
vars.bannerUrl https://i.ibb.co/ZXd7QzS/banner.png



Open maplist.txt  
```
nano ./Instance/mapslist.txt
```
- First line is gamemode for example RUSH CONQUEST etc.
Example:

RUSH

Levels/MP_002 0

Levels/MP_004 0

Levels/MP_005GR 0

Levels/MP_006 0

Levels/MP_007GR 0

Levels/MP_008 0

Levels/MP_009GR 0

Levels/MP_012GR 0

Levels/BC1_Oasis_GR 0

Levels/BC1_Harvest_Day_GR 0

Levels/MP_SP_002GR 0

Remember maps are gamemode dependent!

See all Map names in [DOCS](https://mega.nz/file/zjhkTbqZ#5kbq4FnHke9-C7IzU4m28fJ0MzbCfZ30cJiPxFXagWk), 
Map always starts with Levels/!
## Easy-Administration-Procon
For easy administration download Procon from [here](https://myrcon.net/files/).
Create Connection, enter public IP:48888 from your server and enter password which we set in ServerOptions.ini in /Instance Folder (RemoteAdminPassword) and connect.

## Future-Features
- Integrate Procon Layer for permanent plugins & easy administration
